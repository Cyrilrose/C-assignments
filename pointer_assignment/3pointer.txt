3. Justify that pointer is jewel in C language. Write a function that is passed an 
array of n pointers to floats and returns a newly created array that contains those n float 
values in reverse order. Assume any necessary data.

Pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable i.e. 
it directs the address of the memory location. Pointer can also be known as jewel in C language. 
Some of its reasons are as follows: -

a.	Pointer allows passing array and strings easily from one function to another function.

b.	Pointer makes convenient to manipulate array.


c.	Pointer allows creating complex data structure.

d.	Pointer allows returning more than one value a called function to calling function by reference.

e.	Pointer allows creating data structure such as linked list.

f.	Pointer allows conveniently obtaining memory from the system.
