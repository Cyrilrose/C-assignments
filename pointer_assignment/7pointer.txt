7. Explain the pointer to structure with example.
Pointers can be accessed along with structures. A pointer variable of structure can be created as below:
	
struct name {
member1;
member2;
.
.
};
………inside function………..
struct name *ptr;
Here, the pointer variable of type struct name is created.
Structure's member through pointer can be used in two ways:
1.	Referencing pointer to another address to access memory
2.	Using dynamic memory allocation

Example :-  

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
struct student_database
{
    char name[10];
    int roll;								Output: 7
    int marks;
}stud1;								

stud1.roll = 10;
stud1.marks = 90;

printf("Roll Number : %d\n",stud1.roll);
printf("Marks of Student : %d\n",stud1.marks);

return 0;
}
