 1. What is pointer and explain its applications. Write a program that uses pointers to copy an array of double.

->A pointer is a variable that contains a memory address of variable. Since these memory addresses are the
 locations in the computer memory where program instructions and data are stored, pointers can be used to access
  and manipulate data stored in the memory. Pointers are undoubtedly one of the most distinct features of C languages.
  It has added power and flexibility to the language tool and handy to use once they are mastered.

There is various application of pointer. Some of them are listed below: -

1.	Pointer is widely used in Dynamic Memory Allocation.

2.	Pointer can be used to pass information back and forth between a function and its reference point.

3.	Pointers provide an alternative way to access individual array elements.

4.	Pointers increase the execution speed as they refer address.

5.	Pointers are used to create complex data structures such as linked list, trees, graphs and so on.

6.	Pointer reduces length and complexity of program.

7.	The use of pointer arrays to character strings results in saving of data storage space in memory.

8.	Pointers are more efficient in handling arrays and data tables.
