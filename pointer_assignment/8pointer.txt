8. Explain the pointer arithmetic with example.
	Various arithmetic operators used in pointers can be said as pointer arithmetic. Some of them are as follow: -
	a. Increment (++): Increase value of pointer by 1.
b. Decrement (--): Decrease value of pointer by 1.
c. Comparison (==, <,>): Compares pointer values.
     It can be further understood clearly by the help of following example: -

a.	Increment : 
	#include <stdio.h>

int MAX = 3;

int main () {

   int  var[] = {10, 100, 200};
   int  i, *ptr;

   /* let us have array address in pointer */
   ptr = var;
	
   for ( i = 0; i < MAX; i++) {

      printf("Address of var[%d] = %x\n", i, ptr );
      printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr );

      /* move to the next location */
      ptr++;
   }
	
   return 0;
}								Output: 8a 

b.	Decrement:
#include <stdio.h>

 int MAX = 3;	

int main () {
								
   int  var[] = {10, 100, 200};
   int  i, *ptr;

   /* let us have address of the first element in pointer */
   ptr = var;
   i = 0;
	
   while ( ptr <= &var[MAX - 1] ) {

      printf("Address of var[%d] = %x\n", i, ptr );
      printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr );

      /* point to the previous location */
      ptr++;
      i++;
   }
	
   return 0;							   Output: 8b
}
